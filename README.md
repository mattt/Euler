# Euler
*Swift Custom Operators for Mathematical Notation*

Euler exploits an undocumented feature of Swift that allows for custom operators using characters in the "Math Symbols" character set. While not recommended for production use, it would be great to include in a Playground for the purposes of teaching.

## Installation

_The infrastructure and best practices for distributing Swift libraries is currently being developed by the developer community during this beta period of the language and Xcode. In the meantime, you can simply add Euler as a git submodule, and drag the `Euler.swift` file into your Xcode project._
